/// Specification of which price component should be used when determining if

/// triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell)
/// or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired
/// behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component.
/// This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to
/// specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any
/// of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction
/// history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an
/// Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the
/// distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the
/// default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special
/// restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this
/// case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural”
/// trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for
/// a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades
/// “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.
